<p class="review-text">I was looking for a financial person I could trust after my previous advisor moved out of state, I was retiring and wanted someone I could confer with face to face. Dave was recommended by a trusted friend. This was 4 years ago and I could not be more pleased. Dave patiently explains all my questions - and gives me sound advice when I ask. I feel comfortable with my financial stability knowing Dave has my best interest at heart.</p>

<p class="review-text">We first heard Dave Stanley about 3 years ago on his Sunday Noon "Safe Money" Broadcast on WOOD Radio, Grand Rapids, Michigan. It was such a new concept for us.... so we made an appointment! Dave is an outstanding, faith-based, honest, down-to-earth, knowledgeable man, and easy to talk to; he was interested in finding out "where we were at" with our goals, etc., with no pressure and not "pushy". In about a week, he made a plan/recommendation for us; and thoroughly went over it with us in his office, answering any and all questions we had, assuring us he keeps a watchful eye on any new developments. He has most definitely gone the "extra mile" for us! We have appreciated his sincere efforts and guidance and are only sorry we didn't know about him before! Thanks again, Dave to you and your helpful office staff, too! "It's a Good, 'Settled' Place to Be"! ***************</p>

<p class="review-text">We are so glad that we found Dave Stanley at Integrity Financial Service. We heard him on the radio and were instantly drawn to his calm, common sense approach to investing. We are knocking on the door of our retirement years and are very averse to risk and the wild unpredictability of the stock market. The "nest egg" that we have labored so long to accumulate is now safe and secure (and growing!) thanks to Dave's expert advice. He has given us wise counsel and exhibited gentle sensitivity to our needs and concerns. Dave is not just a wise investment strategist...he is a kind, caring human being. We highly recommend Integrity Financial Service to anyone looking for a secure financial future.</p>

<p class="review-text">Well I've been with integrity for 3yrs and have had nothing but good experiences.the reason I contacted Dave was I went to my back to transfer my 401k over because I change jobs and my new job didn't have a 401k.and the bank gave me a bad vibe like they where trying to sell something.And when I contacted Dave he made me feel comfortable.</p>

<p class="review-text">I am someone who would avoid financial matters as some would avoid the dentist. It was nice my husband took care of that but then he died. And as much as he tried to prepare me, I was lost. It was very reassuring that he trusted Dave and it was easy to see why. Dave is very aware of the person he is talking to and can explain what he is doing with my money and why. Even if I would rather just sign papers and go, he feels he needs to let me know what he has done and why. I feel very secure Dave is taking care of my finances and my future.</p>

<p class="review-text">After retiring and moving to Grand Rapids Max and I both wanted to choose a financial manager for our funds. It was difficult leaving behind those previous contacts in whom we had built trusting relationships. We were given Dave?s name by a family friend. We went in to meet with him and he was very helpful. Never in a rush and an excellent communicator. His experience and integrity and his code of ethics in business are related to his relationship to family, friends, and God. Thank you Dave, Alfa and Max</p>

<p class="review-text">Dave has been a great help in developing a retirement income plan. He provided a number of suggestions and addressed questions and concerns in a very forthright manner during our first couple of meetings. No hard sell, just information and the decisions were left up to me. Now after a year and actually going into retirement, Dave is still addressing questions and making sure that the retirement income stream works as planned and expected. I would recommend Dave to anyone looking for investment advice and/or retirement income planning.</p>

<p class="review-text">I can honestly say that there is no one I would trust more with our investments than Dave. He makes sure all of our questions are answered, and his explanations are so easy to understand. It is rare to find a financial advisor who genuinely cares for his clients. His commitment, values, and faith makes Integrity Financial one in a million. The only regret I have is that I didn't meet him sooner!!!</p>

<p class="review-text">Dave was recommended to us 9 years ago. We was loosing money right and left in the stock market. Dave showed us a way to keep what was left, plus we received a bonus for joining. We also was guaranteed 8.5 interest for the first 10 yrs. at that time. We have had a great relationship with Dave over the years. He is passionate about keeping the resources we have. We like the peace of mind it gives us. We would highly recommend him.</p>

<p class="review-text">We first heard of Integrity Financial through a radio program. At the time I was getting very frustrated watching the Stock Market eating up too much of the money we were investing. Listening to Dave Stanley piqued my interest and so we went to see him. In my opinion he was a Godsend for us. We moved money over to Integrity Financial and started to have peace of mind. No more watching our money disappear in Stock Market fluctuations. It is certainly nice to know that our future is more secure and to know that we are not losing our retirement to the Stock Market. Dave Stanley's investment strategy has been very beneficial for us.</p>

<p class="review-text">My relationship with Dave S (Integrity Financial Services) has been since 2012. He is very attuned to our financial needs and what we needed to do to grow our money to retire with no worries.Dave analyzed our needs and wants. He recommended a customized safe money portfolio, that would grow in a dependable and predictable way. Which would give us complete safety on the downside and lifetime income we can't outlive. We have had no losses no matter what the market is doing.Dave is very accomodating to our schedules and met with us whenever we needed to see him.I'm very grateful that my husband and I met Dave when we did. Our lives have been changed for the better. We have no worries.</p>

<p class="review-text">Hello my name is ***. I first heard of Dave S****** and save money radio ,so I called Dave and asked him some questions he answered my questions. He always answered my questions was super nice, patient and very good at his job. Dave is a great example and definition of a Fiduciary. Someone who cares for people and is very trustworthy. I worked in a factory for almost 40 years and I was ready to get out, so between my 401K and my pension Dave was able to get me out of there at 59 years old. Now my investments with Dave are in safe money. I don't have to worry anymore about losing money or what the stock market does, between my Heavenly Father and Dave S****** I have never been so happy.Thank you integrity financial ***.</p>

<p class="review-text">I have been working with Dave for the past 13 years and my portfolio has improved each year that I have been with him. When the market has dipped, I have not had any losses, in fact I actually made a little. Dave has kept me up to date in how I should change or leave my current status of each of my investments and I continue to increase my port folio each year except for the required minimum payments. Dave is a very easy man to talk to about investments and I would encourage any one, especially if they were about to retire, to contact him to secure your investments. The investments that I currently have allows me to not worry about losses even when the market drops. I may not earn anything but I for sure will not lose any of what I have. It would be well worth your time to talk with him about your financial status. Over the past years that I have been with him I have nearly doubled my investments. Whenever I have concerns about my investments, I give Dave a call and he always gives me solid advice and that has produced positive results. ***</p>
